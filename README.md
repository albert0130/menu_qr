## Showcase

This project was designed to demonstrate:

- Use of React with Typescript and TailwindCSS to build a modern and responsive user interface.
- Utilization of a variety of libraies, such as @shortcm/qr-image for QR code generation and React Hot Toast for notifications.
- Implementation of asynchronous programming techniques to fetch and manipulate data from a backend-as-a-service platform.

LastQR is a web-based application that allows restaurant customers to access menus via QR codes. The app was developed using modern web technologies, including React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Supabase.

The front-end of the app was built using React, which provides a component-based architecture for building user interfaces. I used Next.js as the framework to support server-side rendering, which improves the app's performance and search engine optimization. To design the app's user interface, I used TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-built styles and classes for rapid development.

The app's functionality was implemented using React's state management and lifecycle methods, which provides interactivity and logic to the user interface. Specifically, the app uses React hooks to handle QR code scanning, API requests, and menu item selection. To ensure that the app is fast and responsive, I used asynchronous programming techniques, such as Promises and async/await, to handle API requests and prevent blocking the user interface. To fetch menu data from the back-end, the app uses Supabase, a backend-as-a-service platform that provides a PostgreSQL database and API.

During the development process, I used several development tools and libraries to improve my productivity and code quality. For example, I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor, and Git for version control. Additionally, I used a variety of libraries, including @shortcm/qr-image for QR code generation, and React Hot Toast for notifications.

## Usage example

The usage of the QR Menu App is straightforward: diners simply scan the QR code using their smartphone's camera, and the app will take them to the restaurant's digital menu. From there, they can browse through the items, without the need for physical menus. This makes the dining experience more convenient and efficient, especially during busy hours.
